Openmw Lua is still early in development, please consider this. The mod may not be fully feature complete!

Note:
Guards will only protect the player if crime level is 0.
The ESP plugin file is required as of OpenMW version 0.48, to detect crime level (bounty level). Without this information, 
this mod will not work properly.

Feel free to modify the mod to suit your personal preference.
